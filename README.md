Hello, fellow human beings, 

my name is in the title. I am a hobbyist developer. I started on Python and only knew the basics. Then learned Blueprints in UE4 and decided that it would be better to use C++. So I did learn it to an extent and made a dumb chatbot with it. I learned some C# and SQL. Then made a Yeelight C++ API. I began tinkering with Linux and finally switched to it. I made a small Android app which I can not ever release. It was just a little experiment, which should not be ever used. After that, and tried to learn ASP.NET and grew to hate it. This led to me learning Angular. The next step was Node.js and Express.js. In my little side-projects, I relearned some Python, as I have forgotten it. Around that time, I started working on Taskizer.

**Note:** Maybe my view on ASP.NET would be different now as I am more experienced. 

## Projects

### [TaskizerDesktop](https://github.com/SimonBrandner/TaskizerDesktop.git)

Taskizer was my first big project on which I achieved a certain level of completeness. I made it because I was unhappy with other services like Todoist, MS ToDo and others. They either do not support nested tasks, reminders and other features, or these features are paid. I abandoned the project because, as usual, I stopped having so much fun working on it. If I were to do the project now, I would do quite some things differently. That is why I archived, and I probably will not work on it in the future.

### [i3-pager](https://github.com/duvholt/i3-pager)

I got myself a second monitor, and after some time I realized that [Plasma pager](https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Pager) does not do the best job at working with multiple monitors, at least not with my setup. 

While trying to figure out a way to make it work better, I stumbled on this project. I installed it, and it worked perfectly. But there were a few features I wanted, and they were not there yet. So I decided to add them.

Shout-out to [Christian Duvholt](https://github.com/duvholt) for creating this project and being friendly while I was terrified! It was my first time contributing to an open-source project.

### [[matrix]](https://github.com/matrix-org)

For a long time, I have been looking for an instant messaging and VoIP solution. Never really found one so I have settled on using multiple apps. Once I have discovered [matrix]. For a long time, I have been just waiting for it to get better, but with the newly gained confidence, I have decided to contribute. 

Currently, I am trying to improve [Element](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web) in my free time.

## [dotfiles](https://github.com/SimonBrandner/dotfiles)

As a Linux user, I, of course, put my dotfiles on GitHub.
