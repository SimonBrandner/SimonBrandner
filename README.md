Hello, fellow human beings, 

My name is in the title. I am a mostly self-taught hobbyist programmer. I love Linux and like FOSS software. 

I have a certain level of proficiency in JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, C++, LaTeX and MarkDown. I can code a bit in Python, C# and Java. And I've heard of Brainfuck and wrote Hello World in OSTRAJava.
