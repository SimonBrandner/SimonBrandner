# Å imon Brandner

Hello, fellow human beings, 

My name is in the title. I am a mostly self-taught hobbyist programmer. I love Linux and like FOSS software. 

I have a certain level of proficiency in JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS and C++. I can also code a bit in Python, C# and Java.

My human interaction skills can be lacking, so in advance, I apologize for any of my missteps if we ever happen t interact.

## Projects

### [TaskizerDesktop](https://github.com/SimonBrandner/TaskizerDesktop.git)

Taskizer was my first big project on which I achieved a certain level of completeness. Its primary purpose was to a featureful FOSS task-management app.

The project is archived. If I were to do the project now, I would do quite some things differently.

### [i3-pager](https://github.com/duvholt/i3-pager)

i3-pager is a Plasma widget for people who use Plasma with i3wm. When I stumbled upon this, there were a few features that were missing. So I decided to add them.

Shout-out to [Christian Duvholt](https://github.com/duvholt) for creating this project, and being friendly while I was terrified! It was my first time contributing to an open-source project.

### [[matrix]](matrix-org)

I've recently discovered [matrix], an open network for secure, decentralized communication. Currently, I am trying to improve [Element](element.io) in my free time.

## [dotfiles](https://github.com/SimonBrandner/dotfiles)

As a Linux user, I, of course, put my dotfiles on GitHub.
