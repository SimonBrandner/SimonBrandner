# Å imon Brandner 
Hello there, 

my name is in the title. I am a hobbyist developer. I started on Python, I knew only the basics. Then learned Blueprints in UE4 and decided that it would be better to use C++. So I did learn it to an extent and made a dumb chatbot with it. I learned some C# and SQL. Then made a Yeelight C++ API. I began tinkering with Linux and finally switched to it. I made a small Android app which I can't ever release. It was only a little experiment and the app should never be used. After that, and tried to learn ASP.NET and grew to hate it. Leading to me learning Angular. I grew to love it, as it felt it made sense compared to ASP.NET. Maybe my view on ASP.NET would be different now as I am more experienced. The next step was Node.js and Express.js. In my little side-projects, I relearned some Python, as I've completely forgotten it. Around that time I started working on Taskizer.

## Projects

### [TaskizerDesktop](https://github.com/SimonBrandner/TaskizerDesktop.git)

For the last several months, I have been working on this project. I did so because I was unhappy with other services like Todoist, MS ToDo and others. They either don't support nested tasks, reminders and other features or these features are paid. Taskizer is currently in beta development. Once the desktop app has is in a full-featured state, I am going to start working on the mobile app.

## [dotfiles](https://github.com/SimonBrandner/dotfiles)
As a Linux user, I, of course, put my dotfiles on GitHub.
